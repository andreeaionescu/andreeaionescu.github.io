Very recently I came across the concept of "serverless" so I decided to deep dive and find out more about it. First of all, the concept means exactly what it says - no servers. Well, not really..there are servers somewhere, but the best part is that you can build and run applications and services without worrying too much about servers configuration. The machine resources are allocated on-demand basis by the cloud provider such as Amazon which makes the idea of serverless a cloud computing execution model. I put this theory into practice and leveraged the capabilities offered by AWS Amplify.
