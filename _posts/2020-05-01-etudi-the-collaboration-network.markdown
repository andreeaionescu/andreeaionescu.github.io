Etudi is the collaboration network where academia and the industry meet to discuss ideas, share information, interpretate experiments as well as publish these findings in order to drive innovation and significantly improve the quality of the research papers. 

### Where did the idea come from?

In the spring of 2020, I found myself spending a lot of time indoors given the uncertainty of the pandemic. As I was catching up with one of my friends, we were discussing the challenges faced by students when it comes to searching for and writing academic papers. We quickly reached to the conclusion that research departments from both academia and the industry would be more productive if they could share ideas and experiment results in a digital environment that would facilitate publishing as well. That is when the idea of building a collaboration network was born.

### Results driven by the Agile Methodology

As the lead and only developer on the project, building a collaboration network from scratch sounded exciting and scary at the same time. Regardless, I rolled up my sleeves and started coding and dedicating 12 hours per week on average. Using the [Agile Methodology][agile] in delivering the work helped a lot. My friend and I would have weekly catch-ups on Sundays where we would look at the [Trello Board][trello], discuss the progress and divide the business and tech tasks among ourselves.

4 months later, we built the alpha version of the etudi platform, had a business proposal and received endorsement from academics of the Medical Sciences Division from the Oxford University. The alpha version of the etudi platform consisted of allowing users to quickly search and read scientific papers in a friendly UI by connecting to the [PubMed Database][pubmed] from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information][ncbi]. Users could also create accounts or login using existing credentials in order to add the articles to a list of favourites for further reference.
