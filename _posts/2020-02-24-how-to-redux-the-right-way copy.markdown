Redux is not for every web application, there are certain use cases where it actually makes sense. For example, imagine you built a small UI and keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient. Other reasons why to choose Redux are the need for a single source of truth for your state as well as reasonable amounts of data changing over time.
