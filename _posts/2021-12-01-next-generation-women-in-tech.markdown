Hi! I started my career as a software engineer approximately 6 years ago in the financial industry sector. At that time, there were not that many female engineers among my peers. I found it strange, given that, at Bucharest University of Economic Studies where I graduated from, the percentage of female vs. male computer scientists students was equal. I decided to change the status quo and get involved in initiatives that would make a difference. 

## STEMettes

In 2016-2019 I got involved as a Python teaching assistant in the coding events organised by Bank of America in partnership with [STEMettes][stemettes]. These events really made a difference in showing younger generations how fun coding is and how Technology can contribute to the social good. The participants were as little as 5 year-olds all the way to late teens. The overall feedback was extremely positive with an average of 90% participants more likely to consider pursuing careers in STEM.

## Ada. National College for Digital Skills

Another volunteering project I got involved in 2018 was related to guiding college students to choose the career path that suits them best. As an industry coach at the [Ada College][ada-college], I had 1-1 meetings with the amazing Chayann, co-founder of [CodeHidden][code-hidden]. Apart from helping with her CV and personal statement, I have encouraged her to purse her passion and build her confidence. The results were tremendous as she has been awarded top 3 Young Digital Leader of the Year and wrote a very cool article for [TimesHigherEducation][times-higher-education] about Women in STEM and myself.

>During my meetings with Andreea-Maria, I am able to share my thoughts and ideas freely. She is someone who I look up to, as sheâ€™s been through most of the things I will be facing at the start of my career. She has helped to build my confidence in my strengths, skills and knowledge.

## Code First Girls

4 years ago I started volunteering as lead coding instructor for [Code First Girls][code-first-girls]. Their main aim is to organise coding courses within universities or company offices which equip young women with the skills and confidence to pursue a career in tech. The majority of the participants do not come from a Computer Science background. They are absolute beginners in their coding journey. After leading 4 courses where more than 100 students attended, I am proud to mention that a high percentage has secured jobs in Technology as software developers. One of my students, Maria wrote a blog post about her journey entitled ["From Studying Chinese To Becoming A JavaScript Developer"][studying-chinese-to-becoming-dev].

## Collaborations

In 2019 I collaborated with [Education and Employers][education-and-employers] and [iCould][iCould] for a video interview about my career journey as software engineer. The video is now part of a large database used to inspire younger generations to make informed decisions about their careers.

Another initiative by Education and Employers was [Inspiring Women][inspiring-women] where representatives from different industries were invited for speed networking over lunch time. From the 250 students who participated, I interacted to nearly half of them and encouraged them to stay focused on their studies instead of popularity and to not be afraid of trying new activities unrelated to their everyday coursework as coding can be fun too.

["1 Million Women In STEM"][1mwis] is a global campaign which aims to spotlight real women in STEM by sharing their stories, hence creating the largest database of this kind, in order to showcase visible role models and inspire the next generation of girls. [On my profile][1mwis-me], I share my background and why I love working in Technology as well as offer a few pieces of advice for the readers, one of them being:

>Knowledge is power. Stay focused. Choose studies over popularity. In the end it will pay off.

## Bank of America's Women's Developers Group - London Chapter

As one of the co-chairs and leaders for over 4 years now, I am behind a growing community of over 200 developers where members meet on a monthly basis in a friendly environment where they network, share expertise and learn from each other. A few flagships events are monthly lunchtime tech talks, Technical Book Club and quarterly newsletters with latest news in Tech. Following the success of the London community, 7 more chapters have opened across AMRS and APAC regions.

## Final thoughts

Every little thing adds up in the grand scheme of things and numbers speak for themselves. Based on the [2020 survey conducted by AnitaB.org][anita-borg], the overall percentage of women in technology increased by 3.5 percentage points compared to 2018 and 2019.

Volunteering is what makes us human, helping one another in times of need brings a different kind of joy. I am grateful and humble for every award I have received as a result of helping others succeed.
